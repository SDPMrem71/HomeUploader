Forked from original repository to maintain and configure for private networks (LAN) like **Home**, In order to create a simple file uploader.

* Added **pm2** in order to act like a server.
* Added **HTTPS** with self signed certificate (auto create).

## *Original Source*: **[Filing Saucer](https://github.com/enbytedev/Filing-Saucer-V1)**
